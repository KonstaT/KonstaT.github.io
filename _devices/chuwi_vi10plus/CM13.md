Here's an early taste of Marshmallow for Chuwi Vi10 Plus & Hi10 Plus. Chuwi Hi10 Pro & Hibook are supported with compatibility patch (see installation instructions below). Hibook Pro and Hi12 are no longer supported due to lack of kernel source. It is unofficial and unsupported by the CyanogenMod/LineageOS team. It's for **advanced users** only.

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options, why?  
*A: Settings -> About tablet -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced reboot*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of CM's Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Privacy -> Privacy Guard. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*

Q: I have Hi10 Plus. What should I do?  
*A: Older Hi10 Plus devices don't need any compatibility patch. Devices shipped with 20170220, 20170315, 20170504, 20171020 and 20171229 firmware also work apart from camera and ambient light sensor because of hardware changes and lack of kernel source code.*

Q: I have Hi10 Pro. What should I do?  
*A: Download patch below and install it in TWRP. Hi10 Pro (z8350 - serial no HQ64) is not supported because of hardware changes (touchscreen, camera, ambient light sensor) and lack of kernel source code.*
