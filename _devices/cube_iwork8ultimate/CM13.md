Here's an early taste of Marshmallow for Cube iWork8 Ultimate (I1-T/I1-TD/I1-TWB/I1-TC) and iWork8 Air (I1-TF). It is unofficial and unsupported by the CyanogenMod team. It's for **advanced users** only. This is an early alpha build and it's not recommended for daily use (see issues below).

**Issues:**

- Audio not routed through HDMI
- and more...

**Sources:**

- [CM-CHT](https://github.com/CM-CHT)
