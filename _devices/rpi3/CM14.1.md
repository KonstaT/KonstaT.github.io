**How to install:**

1. Follow the official [Raspberry Pi instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system) for writing the image to the SD card.

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced restart*

Q: I have no root, why? What is that hashtag on my status bar?  
*A: You need enable root access under Settings -> Developer options -> Root access. Root management is now integrated as part of LineageOS' Privacy Guard and you can manage per app permissions under Settings -> Developer options -> Manage root access. You'll have a persistent notification in the status bar when you're running an app that uses root permissions.*

Q: I have official 7" LCD display and touchscreen. What should I do?  
*A: Execute following commands in 'adb shell'/serial console/terminal (you can enable built-in terminal app from Settings -> Developer options -> Local terminal) and reboot your device:*

```
su
rpi3-display.sh
```

Q: Settings -> Storage shows xx GB used by system. There's unallocated space on my sdcard. What should I do?  
*A: This is a 4 GB image, remaining space on your sdcard will remain unallocated. Settings app shows unallocated space as used by system which in reality it is not. You can use e.g. GParted and extend /data partition (/dev/block/mmcblk0p3) to cover the unallocated space. Resizing the partition manually will break support for encrypting /data. Format /data in TWRP recovery (Wipe->Format data) after resizing to leave required space for crypto footer.*

Q: Raspberry Pi doesn't have power button, how do I power off/reboot my device?  
*A: Following keyboard keys work as Android buttons: F1 = Home, F2 = Back, F3 = Multi-tasking, F4 = Menu, F5 = Power, F11 = Volume down, and F12 = Volume up. You can also use one of many third party reboot applications.*

Q: How to boot to TWRP recovery?  
*A: There's currently no proper way to boot between Android and TWRP, but this can achieved by renaming the ramdisk you want to boot. Execute following commands in 'adb shell'/serial console/terminal (you can enable built-in terminal app from Settings -> Developer options -> Local terminal) and reboot your device:*

```
su
rpi3-recovery.sh
```

*If mouse cursor doesn't appear, try replugging your mouse.*

Q: How to boot out of TWRP recovery?  
*A: Flash my [recovery2boot](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=1322778262903982323) zip in TWRP.*

Q: How to install Google apps?  

1. Download [open_gapps-arm-7.1-pico-xxxxxxxx.zip](http://opengapps.org/?arch=arm&api=7.1&variant=pico) and save it to your device's internal storage or use an external USB drive
2. Boot to TWRP recovery (see FAQ)
3. Install open_gapps-arm-7.1-pico-xxxxxxxx.zip from your selected storage
4. Wipe->Factory reset!
5. Boot out of recovery (see FAQ)
