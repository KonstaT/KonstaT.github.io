This ROM is based on official [ZTE N880E MIUI](http://www.miui.com/getrom.php?r=49). Funny thing is that N880E MIUI builds are based on the CM10 device sources that I've released, so thanks to me. ;)

**Changes to N880E version:**

- fixed wifi and bluetooth (N880E has Broadcom wifi/bt, we have Atheros/Qualcomm)
- added [Google Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin)
- added Play Store
- removed Chinese MIUI apps
- used Blade III CM10 kernel ([source](https://github.com/KonstaT/android_kernel_zte_msm7x27a))
- used Blade III [proprietaries](https://github.com/KonstaT/proprietary_vendor_zte/tree/jellybean/atlas40)

Everything should work to CM10 standards except FM radio. Don't expect anything to be fixed (fix it yourself). I don't plan to use/support this ROM. It was just something I played around with for couple of hours. I just thought I'd share it because it's been requested several times and it seems to work well enough.

**How to install:**

1. boot into [ClockWorkMod recovery](/devices/atlas40/CWM)
2. mounts and storage -> format system
3. wipe data and factory reset
4. install zip from sdcard -> choose zip from sdcard -> miui_atlas40_x.x.x_4.1.zip
5. reboot

**How to port:**  
I wrote a simple tool for porting from N880E. You'll need a linux system with few basic packages installed (git, java, zip). Place an official N880E MIUI ROM to the root of the porting tool directory (_place_rom_here_) and run the tool.

```
./port.sh
```
