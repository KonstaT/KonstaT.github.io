**How to install:**

1. boot into [ClockWorkMod](/devices/atlas40/TWRP)
2. backup and restore -> backup (makes a nandroid backup of your previous ROM)
3. mounts and storage -> format /system
4. wipe data and factory reset
5. install cm-11-xxxxxxxx-KonstaKANG-atlas40.zip
6. install gapps-kk-xxxxxxxx-signed.zip
7. reboot now

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options and performance settings, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced reboot*

Q: When I'm connected with an USB cable to my computer, I can't see my internal sdcard as a storage, why?  
*A: I've made an executive decision not to include a mount point for internal sdcard. This is because recent Android versions don't allow setting emulated sdcard as secondary storage. Setting rather small emulated sdcard as a primary storage caused issues with games/apps that want to download large amounts of data to the sdcard.*

Q: There's no transparent status/navigation bar, why?  
*A: It has been disabled on low memory devices. You can enable it by removing/commenting/changing to false 'ro.config.low_ram=true' in /system/build.prop. There's also an option that will only force high-end graphics (Setting -> Performance -> Force high-end graphics).*  

Q: 'OK Google' voice command doesn't work, why? There's no Google Now page on the homescreen, why?  
*A: These are features of proprietary Google Experience Launcher. You'll have to find and install GE Launcher first. 'OK Google' voice command is also disable on low memory devices (see above).*
