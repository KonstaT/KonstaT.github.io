This is my build of [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) for Moto G. This is not meant for daily use (or any use really), it's just something for **advanced users** to play with. I've only tested this on my retail xt1032 but there is also support for the GPE variant as well as xt1033's converted to GPE. Telephony is not working on dual-SIM xt1033.

This build is based on [CAF release](https://www.codeaurora.org/xwiki/bin/FirefoxOS/release) LNX.LF.3.5.1-11900-8x10.0 and it's Boot2Gecko 2.0.0.0-prerelease.

**Working:**

- RIL (mobile network, data & SMS)
- Wifi
- Audio (playback/input/routing/headphones/etc)
- Bluetooth
- Camera (photos & camcorder)
- FM radio
- GPS
- Hardware acceleration and OpenGL rendering
- Hardware video decoding & encoding
- SD card
- Charging & adb
- USB-tethering
- Wifi-tethering
- Touchscreen/multi-touch
- Sensors
- LEDs

**Not working:**

- USB-storage (B2G doesn't support MTP - Moto G doesn't support UMS) - adb push/pull to/from sdcard works after 'adb root'

**Issues:**

- rotation doesn't properly work in the camera app - rotate your device before opening the camera app
- browser's back/next/bookmark/share bar is missing/overlapped by software navigation bar when in portrait mode
