<span style="color:#ff0000;">Do not use this recovery to flash official updates from ZTE website!</span> You need to repack them for ClockWorkMod or use the stock recovery to install.

**How to make clean ROM dump/backup of your device (before you root or install cwm):** (<span style="color:#ff0000;">recommended</span>)
