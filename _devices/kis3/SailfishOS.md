This is my build of [Sailfish OS](https://sailfishos.org/) for ZTE Open C / Kis 3 (Beeline Smart2, Moche/MEO Smart A16, <s>ZTE V811W</s>, ZTE V811, Skinny V811, Optus Hop Smart, <s>ZTE Blade M</s>, etc). This is an early alpha build and it's not meant for daily use (or any use really), it's just something for **advanced users** to play with.

<span style="color:#FF0000;">Important. Prerequisites!!!</span> You need to install Android KitKat on your Open C first (e.g. [EU_FFOS+to+Android.zip](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=4349826312261607875) will do). You also need to have this [ClockWorkMod](/devices/kis3/CWM) or this [TWRP](/devices/kis3/TWRP) recovery installed.

**Working:**

- Audio
- Bluetooth
- Camera (photos & camcorder)
- Display
- GPS
- Headphones (run 'systemctl restart ohmd.service' as root after each reboot)
- Media decoding/encoding with gstreamer codecs
- RIL (voice calls, SMS & mobile data)
- Sensors
- SD card
- Touchscreen
- USB storage (MTP only - choose 'PC connection' mode from settings)
- USB-tethering
- Vibrate
- Wifi
- Wifi-tethering

**Partially working:**

- FM radio - command line, not hooked to UI yet

**Not working:**

- and more...

**Issues:**

- Display auto-brightness is enabled by default on first boot so display is very dark on devices that don't have an ambient light sensor ('Settings -> System -> Display -> Adjust automatically' to disable)
- Display brightness setting allows decreasing brightness below 'minimum' which powers off the panel completely (don't do it ;))
- Proximity sensor disabled for now - wasn't working(?) and would cause display to switch (and stay) off during calls
- <s>There is some kind boot time race condition with systemd services and device fails to boot to Sailfish OS sometimes and reboots itself instead (remove battery, wait for stars to align better and try again :P)</s>
