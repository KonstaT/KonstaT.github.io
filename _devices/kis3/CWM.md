This is my build of Koush's [ClockWorkMod](https://www.clockworkmod.com/) Recovery 6.0.5.1 for ZTE Open C / Kis 3 (Beeline Smart2, Moche/MEO Smart A16, ZTE V811W, ZTE V811, Skinny V811, Optus Hop Smart, ZTE Blade M, etc).

This recovery is fully working with goodies such as repeatable keys and adb sideload support. Use volume keys to navigate menus and power button to select. Internal sdcard is handled differently on Open C and Kis 3 so this recovery only supports external sdcard.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Do not use this recovery to flash official updates from ZTE website!</span> You need to repack them for ClockWorkMod or use the stock recovery to install.

**How to make clean ROM dump/backup of your device (before you root or install CWM):** (<span style="color:#ff0000;">recommended</span>)

- Download recovery-cwm60xx-kis3.img recovery image and rename it to recovery.img
- Create a new directory somewhere and copy adb(.exe), fastboot(.exe) and recovery.img into it
- Enable USB debugging on your device (Firefox OS - Settings -> Device information -> More Information -> Developer -> Remote Debugging --- Android - Settings->Developer options -> Android debugging)
- Plug in your device via USB cable and install drivers if necessary
- Open terminal window as an administrator (windows) or execute adb commands with sudo (linux)
- Change into the directory you've created and execute following commands in terminal window (boots into recovery instead of flashing it)
