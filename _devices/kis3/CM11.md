This is my port of CyanogenMod 11 for ZTE Open C / Kis 3 (Beeline Smart2, Moche/MEO Smart A16, ZTE V811W, ZTE V811, Skinny V811, Optus Hop Smart, ZTE Blade M, etc). It is unofficial and unsupported by the CyanogenMod team. It's for **advanced users** only.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Important. Prerequisites!!!</span> You need to install Android KitKat on your Open C first (e.g. [EU_FFOS+to+Android.zip](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=4349826312261607875) will do). You also need to have this [ClockWorkMod](/devices/kis3/CWM) or this [TWRP](/devices/kis3/TWRP) recovery installed.

**How to install:**

1. boot into [ClockWorkMod recovery](/devices/kis3/CWM)
2. backup and restore -> backup (create a nandroid backup of your current ROM)
3. mounts and storage -> format /system
4. wipe data and factory reset
5. install cm-11-xxxxxxxx-KonstaKANG-kis3.zip
6. install gapps-kk-xxxxxxxx-signed.zip
7. reboot now

**FAQ:**

Q: I can't find developer options and performance settings, why?  
*A: Settings -> About phone -> Click 'Build number' several times*

Q: I don't have reboot options in power menu, why?  
*A: Settings -> Developer options -> Advanced reboot*

Q: When I'm connected with an USB cable to my computer, I can't see my internal sdcard as a storage, why?  
*A: I've made an executive decision not to include a mount point for internal sdcard. This is because recent Android versions don't allow setting emulated sdcard as secondary storage. Setting rather small emulated sdcard as a primary storage caused issues with games/apps that want to download large amounts of data to the sdcard. Also partition layout is different on Open C and Kis 3 and internal sdcard is handled differently between device variants.*

Q: There's no transparent status/navigation bar, why?  
*A: It has been disabled on low memory devices. You can enable it by removing/commenting/changing to false 'ro.config.low_ram=true' in /system/build.prop. There's also an option that will only force high-end graphics (Setting -> Performance -> Force high-end graphics).*

Q: 'OK Google' voice command doesn't work, why? There's no Google Now page on the homescreen, why?  
*A: These are features of proprietary [Google Now Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.launcher). 'OK Google' voice command is also disable on low memory devices (see above).*

Q: There's only a home button on an Open C. How is this going to work?  
*A: There's 'hidden' back and menu keys on left and right side of the home button. There's also an option to use software navigation bar instead of the capacitive keys.*

Q: There's an option to enable auto-brightness but it doesn't work, why? Proximity sensor doesn't work either...  
*A: Open C doesn't have ambient light/proximity sensor. Some Kis 3 variants on the other hand do, so that's why I've kept the support.*

Q: How do I enable dual-SIM features on my V811W?  
*A: Add 'persist.radio.multisim.config=dsds' to /system/build.prop or alternatively 'setprop persist.radio.multisim.config dsds' in rooted adb shell/terminal session. This can also be done by flashing the following package in recovery.*
