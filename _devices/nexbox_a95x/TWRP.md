This device is rooted out-of-the-box and it has unlocked bootloader. Stock recovery also allows flashing zips that are signed with generic test key. I haven't found a way to use adb when connected with an USB cable. There's no way to boot the device into bootloader to use fastboot either. There's still about a dozen ways to install TWRP - here's a few.

**Booting from SD card:**

- Download recovery-twrp3020-nexbox_a95x.img and rename it as recovery.img
- Copy TWRP recovery.img to the root of your external SD card
- Power down your device
- Power up your device by pressing (and holding) reset button found in AV port (use a thin non-metal object - e.g. toothpick, plastic straw, etc)
- Your device will boot into TWRP
- Use TWRP to install the recovery flashable TWRP zip or use TWRP's 'flash image' option to install the TWRP recovery.img
- Reboot recovery

**Using stock recovery:**

- Download recovery-twrp-3.0.2-0-nexbox_a95x.zip and copy it to your external SD card or USB stick
- Power down your device
- Power up your device by pressing (and holding) reset button found in AV port (use a thin non-metal object - e.g. toothpick, plastic straw, etc)
- Select 'apply update from EXT' -> 'update from sdcard/udisk' -> recovery-twrp-3.0.2-0-nexbox_a95x.zip
- Reboot recovery

**Using shell:**

- Download recovery-twrp3020-nexbox_a95x.img and rename it as recovery.img
- Copy TWRP recovery.img to your internal storage, external SD card, or USB stick
- Open e.g. [Terminal Emulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm) and change into the directory you saved the TWRP recovery.img (/sdcard, /storage/sdcard1, or /storage/udisk0, respectively)
- Execute following commands

```
su
dd if=recovery.img of=/dev/block/recovery
```

- Reboot recovery
